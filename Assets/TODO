- fix RadialRule generation (sack the spiral)
- branch nodes don't have to spawn many roads at all times - if they sometimes spawn only one, this will allow for curved roads

Future expansions:
- nodes should be aware of their neighbourhood: if the population density is low but there's enough existing nodes in the vicinity, the production should stop producing the given node further (to avoid the "long parallel roads" problem)
