# Gradovi

This is the city generator I worked on while finishing my studies at the Belgrade University. It's far from complete, but it generates city streets using lots of methods described in Parish and MÃ¼ler's [Procedural Modeling of Cities](http://dynamicstructures.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/documents/public_papers/procedural%20modeling%20of%20city.pdf) paper.

Open the Gradovi.unity scene in Unity and play around with the CityGenerator object.
